# GrandMouse

## Abstract
This web application was focused on creating a dashboard with easy to read information about Disney Characters for new and existing grandparents. In order to keep up with all the new Disney characters, grandparents are able to look through and read about what movies and tv shows they are in. They can also favorite a character to acess it later. I worked with React Framework, a local server, and made network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.

## Setup
Fork and clone this [repo](https://github.com/Devynnem/grandmouse) 

*If you run into any trouble, check this [site](https://status.disneyapi.dev/) to see if the Disneyapi.dev server is running properly.*

Do the following steps for the repo.

In your forked GitHub repository, click the code drop-down menu and copy the SSH key. 
Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the containing directory you’d like - to clone the repository folder and its contents to. On the command line, run “git clone” + the SSH key you copied earlier. A new folder will be created containing a local copy of the repository linked to the forked repository you created - enter the new directory.

Install the library dependencies:

Run: ```npm install```
Next: ```npm start``` in the terminal to see the HTML page

```Control + C``` is the command to stop running the local server

## Reflections: 

I completed this project as part of my Final solo project of Module 3 for the Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program. It is a four module, seven month focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. This project was completed over 5 days in line with the project specification and rubric detailed [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html). This project allowed myself to continue growing my React skills, cypress testing,  and overall my software developer skills. 

## Technologies Used:
React | Cypress | API | CSS | JSX

## Wins/Challenges:
Challenges: 
- One of the major challenges we faced was working with a wild API. The server went down while working on this project which provided some difficulty.

Wins: 
 - Working with React
 - Effectively Fetching data from an API.
 - Continuing growing my CSS and overall developer skills
